# Gabe Sekeres' Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website. This project is built using Quarto and is designed to showcase my work, research, and resources.

## Features
- **Home Page**: An overview of my website.
- **Research**: A section dedicated to my research work.
- **Resources**: A collection of useful resources.
- **CV**: My curriculum vitae.

## Acknowledgements
A lot of the code for this website was inspired by and borrowed from (read: stolen wholesale) my friend Zahra's website. You can check out her amazing work [here](https://zahrathabet.com/).

## Project Structure
- **quarto.yml**: Configuration file for the Quarto project.
- **index.qmd**: The main page of the website.
- **research.qmd**: The research page.
- **resources.qmd**: The resources page.
- **cv.qmd**: The CV page.
- **styles.css**: Custom styles for the website.

## How to Run
To run this project locally, you will need to have Quarto installed. Once you have Quarto, you can render the website by running:
```bash

```
and publish the website by running:
```bash
quarto publish
```
