I'm a [Predoctoral Research Fellow at SIEPR](https://siepr.stanford.edu/programs/predoctoral-research-fellowship-opportunities) where I work with Professor [Neale Mahoney](https://nmahoney.people.stanford.edu/). 

Previously, I was a predoctoral fellow for [Heidi Williams](https://sites.google.com/view/heidi-l-williams/home) where I researched metascience. In a previous life, I was an undegraduate at [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu/) where I studied economics and math. In my free time I powerlift.

I'm broadly interested in topics of health and household finance economics.
