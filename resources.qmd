### My Setup

- Notes / writing

  - Most of my current projects (and all coauthored ones) are on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) with dropbox integration.

  - For notes, I use [Texifier](https://www.texifier.com/). You can edit documents in dropbox synced with Overleaf, so it's easy.

  - Also I store notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vaults in a dropbox folder. Note that Obsidian can't render .tex files, which is why I like Texifier so much -- it compiles, saves, and overwrites the pdf automatically.

- Hardware

  - Currently using a [Logi wave](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/wave-keys-mac.920-012402.html?srsltid=AfmBOopN3JJ-e2rhKv8sMXw6VcFkFWh1vchXbcUGqKvK3QpcC9VX4al6) keyboard. It's solid, but I'll be replacing it with a [Microsoft Sculpt](https://www.incase.com/pages/incase-designed-by-microsoft) once Incase actually allows me to buy one.

  - [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3.910-005647.html). It's the best for a reason.

- Software

  - Everything here is for MacOS. I have a MacBook Pro and have never wanted to switch to PC.

  - I used [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build this website.

  - For coding, I use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).
  
  - I also use [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control, and do all of this through terminal on Mac. I'm a novice, but it's easy to learn.
  
  - For empirical work, I use [Stata](https://www.stata.com/). I've always had an academic affiliation, so this is costless. Sorry to everyone who doesn't.
  
### Notes

There are a lot of extremely good free class notes available online. Here are some of the ones that I've found particularly useful.

 - [Causal Inference](https://web.stanford.edu/~swager/stats361.pdf): Stefan Wager's notes is the standard for a reason. These are brilliant
 
 - [Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf): One of the best courses I've ever taken.
 
 - [Machine Learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/): Really good reference, especially their primers for Linear Algebra and Probability.

 - [Undergraduate Probability](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/sites/projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/stat110/files/final_review.pdf) and [Graduate Probability](https://www.ekzhang.com/assets/pdf/Stat_210_Notes.pdf): Joe Blitzstein is the best.

### Textbooks

I'm not going to put pirated PDFs on my website. However, these textbooks are all great and significantly better than their peers. Get them if you want.

- [Foundations of Mathematical Analysis](https://store.doverpublications.com/products/9780486477664?srsltid=AfmBOorFb4OiJiAFEqwqvA4-L0SsvZwsSinm-ZkiYVgPrPlXv5hKGRy6): By far the best analysis textbook I've ever used. By pacing, it assumes some prior knowledge, but otherwise is entirely self-contained. I own a copy purely as a reference.
 
- Microeconomic Theory: The first-year PhD sequence at Stanford is built off of three textbooks, from which the professors create a comprehensive set of lecture notes. Together, the textbooks work a lot better than courses from just one of them.
 
  - [Microeconomic Theory (MWG)](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/microeconomic-theory-9780195073409?cc=us&lang=en&), [Microeconomic Analysis (Varian)](https://wwnorton.com/books/Microeconomic-Analysis), and [Microeconomic Foundations (Kreps)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691155838/microeconomic-foundations-i?srsltid=AfmBOoqam1kMulCuvrF0qG-yEE6wJUmu4Xxh8vH3WiGro37148tI2Kz-)

- [Game Theory](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262650403/a-course-in-game-theory/): Just a great textbook. I read it cover to cover once.
